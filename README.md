This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# "Hot Dog! 101"
### An interactive webcomic built with Javascript frameworks and libraries aimed at making understanding U.S. politics more engaging and educational!
This is an NYU Shanghai Interactive Media Arts '19 Senior Capstone project.

## Hot Dogs?
Ah, well, yeah! Nothing as American as hot dogs (and U.S. politics), right? I was looking for the most innocuous way to have cute webcomics while hiding political/education connotations and a dachshund wearing a bun backpack seemed like a great way to go about it.

## Why?
For now, please find out more on my portfolio site and check out the IMA [project proposal](https://milliewong.myportfolio.com/current-project-senior-capstones) I have there!
